<h1>A Tour of the Debugger</h1>
<p>This module assumes you have completed the <a
href="A1-GettingStarted.html">Getting Started</a> module. If not, please
go back.</p>
<p>This module will briefly introduce each window in the Ghidra
Debugger. We assume some familiarity with trap-and-trace debugging. If
you have not used GDB or a similar debugger before, you may find the
Ghidra Debugger difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>If you would like your tool to look more or less like the one
presented in the screenshots here, launch <code>termmines</code> from
the Debugger using GDB.</p>
<section id="the-debugger-tool" class="level2">
<h2>The Debugger Tool</h2>
<p>Like the CodeBrowser tool, the Debugger tool is a preconfigured
collection of plugins and panels that present Ghidra’s dynamic analysis
features. You may re-configure, save, export, import, etc. the tool to
fit your preferences. For reference, here is a screenshot of the default
configuration after launching <code>termmines</code>:</p>

<section id="toolbar" class="level3">
<h3>Toolbar</h3>
<p>Many of the buttons in the global toolbar are the same as in the
CodeBrowser. Coincidentally, in the screenshot, the debugger-specific
buttons start just above the Dynamic Listing in the global toolbar. They
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="images/process.png" alt="emulate button" />
<strong>Emulate</strong>: To be covered in a later module. This will
load the current program (from the Static Listing) into the
emulator.</li>
<li><img src="images/debugger.png" alt="debug button" />
<strong>Debug</strong>: This launches the current program (from the
Static Listing) using a suitable back-end debugger. The drop-down menu
provides a selection of suitable back-end connectors. Clicking the
button will use the last successful connector or the default.</li>
<li><img src="images/record.png" alt="mode button" /> <strong>Control
Mode</strong>: This drop-down menu sets the mode of the controls and
machine state edits. By default, all actions are directed to the
back-end debugger.</li>
<li><img src="images/resume.png" alt="resume button" />
<strong>Resume</strong>: Resume execution. This is equivalent to
<code>continue</code> in GDB.</li>
<li><img src="images/interrupt.png" alt="interrupt button" />
<strong>Interrupt</strong>: Interrupt, suspend, pause, break, etc. This
is equivalent to <strong>Ctrl-C</strong> or <code>interrupt</code> in
GDB.</li>
<li><img src="images/kill.png" alt="kill button" />
<strong>Kill</strong>: Kill, terminate, etc. This is equivalent to
<code>kill</code> in GDB.</li>
<li><img src="images/disconnect.png" alt="disconnect button" />
<strong>Disconnect</strong>: Disconnect from the back-end debugger.
Typically, this will also end the session. It is equivalent to
<code>quit</code> in GDB.</li>
<li><img src="images/stepinto.png" alt="step into button" />
<strong>Step Into</strong>, <img src="images/stepover.png"
alt="step over button" /> <strong>Step Over</strong>, <img
src="images/stepout.png" alt="step out button" /> <strong>Step
Out</strong>, <img src="images/steplast.png" alt="step last button" />
<strong>Step Last</strong>: These buttons step in various ways. In
order, the equivalent commands in GDB are <code>stepi</code>,
<code>nexti</code>, and <code>finish</code>. Step Last has no equivalent
in GDB; it is meant to repeat the last custom/extended step.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="windows" class="level3">
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Starting at the top left and working clockwise, the windows are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Debugger Targets</strong> window: This lists active
sessions or connections. From here, you can establish new sessions or
terminate existing sessions.</li>
<li>The <strong>Dynamic Listing</strong> window: This is the primary
means of examining the instructions being executed. By default, it
follows the program counter and disassembles from there until the next
control transfer instruction. It supports many of the same operations as
the Static Listing, including patching. The nearest equivalent in GDB is
something like <code>x/10i $pc</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Interpreter</strong> window: This is essentially a
terminal emulator providing a command-line interface to the back-end
debugger. It is useful for diagnostics or for issuing commands that do
not have a button in the GUI. Some may also prefer to command the
debugger from here rather than the GUI.</li>
<li>The <strong>Breakpoints</strong> window: This is stacked below the
Interpreter. It lists and manages the breakpoints among all open images
and running targets. The nearest equivalent in GDB is
<code>info break</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Registers</strong> window: This is stacked below the
Breakpoints window. It displays and edits the register values for the
current thread. The nearest equivalent in GDB is
<code>info registers</code></li>
<li>The <strong>Modules</strong> window: This is stacked below the
Registers window. It displays the images (and sections, if applicable)
loaded by the target. The equivalent in GDB is
<code>maintenance info sections</code>. Note that this differs from the
Regions window.</li>
<li>The <strong>Threads</strong> window: This lists the threads in the
current target. The tabs at the top list the active targets. The nearest
equivalents in GDB are <code>info threads</code> and
<code>info inferiors</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Time</strong> window: This is stacked below the Threads
window. This lists the events and snapshots taken of the current
target.</li>
<li>The <strong>Stack</strong> window: This lists the stack frames for
the current thread. The equivalent in GDB is
<code>backtrace</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Watches</strong> window: This is stacked below the Stack
window — pun not intended. It manages current watches. These are
<em>not</em> watchpoints, but rather expressions or variables whose
values to display. To manage watchpoints, use the Breakpoints window or
the Interpreter. The nearest equivalent in GDB is
<code>display</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Regions</strong> window: This is stacked below the
Watches window. It lists memory regions for the current target. It
differs from the Modules window, since this includes not only
image-backed regions but other memory regions, e.g., stacks and heaps.
The equivalent in GDB is <code>info proc mappings</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Debug Console</strong> window: (Not to be confused with
the Console window from the CodeBrowser.) This displays logging messages
and problems encountered during a session. Some problems are presented
with remedial actions, which may expedite your workflow or aid in
troubleshooting.</li>
<li>The <strong>Objects</strong> window: This models the back-end
debugger as a tree of objects and provides generic actions on those
objects. It is generally more capable, though less integrated, than the
GUI, but not quite as capable as the Interpreter. It is useful for
troubleshooting and for advanced use cases.</li>
</ul>

<section id="controlling-the-target" class="level2">
<h2>Controlling the Target</h2>
<p>The control buttons are all located on the global toolbar. Start by
pressing the <img src="images/stepinto.png" alt="step into" /> Step Into
button. Notice that the Dynamic Listing moves forward a single
instruction each time you press it. Also notice that the Static Listing
moves with the Dynamic Listing. You may navigate in either listing, and
so long as there is a corresponding location in the other, the two will
stay synchronized. You may also open the Decompiler just as you would in
the CodeBrowser, and it will stay in sync, too.</p>
<p>When you have clicked <img src="images/stepinto.png"
alt="step into" /> Step Into a sufficient number of times, you should
end up in a subroutine. You can click <img src="images/stepout.png"
alt="step out" /> Step Out to leave the subroutine. Note that the target
is allowed to execute until it returns from the subroutine; it does not
skip out of it. Now, click <img src="images/stepover.png"
alt="step over" /> Step Over until you reach another <code>CALL</code>
instruction. Notice that when you click <img src="images/stepover.png"
alt="step over" /> Step Over again, it will not descend into the
subroutine. Instead, the target is allowed to execute the entire
subroutine before stopping again — after the <code>CALL</code>
instruction.</p>
<p>If you prefer, you may use the GDB commands from the Interpreter
instead of the buttons. Try <code>si</code> and/or <code>ni</code>. You
can also pass arguments which is not possible with the buttons,
e.g. <code>si 10</code> to step 10 instructions in one command.</p>
<p>If you need to terminate the target you should use the <img
src="images/disconnect.png" alt="disconnect" /> Disconnect button rather
than the Kill button, in general. Otherwise, each launch will create a
new connection, and you will end up with several stale connections.
Additionally, if your target exits or otherwise terminates on its own,
you will get a stale connection. Use the Targets window to clean such
connections up. The re-use of connections and/or the use of multiple
concurrent connections is <em>not</em> covered in this course.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<section
id="the-listings-are-not-in-sync-i.e.-they-do-not-move-together."
class="level3">
<h3>The listings are not in sync, i.e., they do not move together.</h3>
<p>First, check that synchronization is enabled. This is the default
behavior, but, still, check it first. In the top-right of the Dynamic
Listing is its local drop-down menu. Click it and check that
<strong>Auto-Sync Cursor with Static Listing</strong> is selected.</p>
<p>If that does not work, check the top-left label of the Dynamic
Listing to see what module you are in. Also check the Debug Console
window. If you are in a system library, e.g., <code>ld-linux</code>,
then this is the expected behavior. You may optionally import it, as
suggested by the Debug Console, but this is covered later.</p>
<p>If you are not in a system library, then check the Modules window to
see if <code>termmines</code> is listed. If so, it seems the module
mapper failed to realize that module is the current program. Right-click
the module and select “Map to termmines.” Confirm the dialog. If
<code>termmines</code> is not listed, then your version of GDB may not
be supported. If you file a bug report, please include your GDB version,
Linux distribution, and/or other platform details.</p>
</section>
<section
id="the-listings-seem-to-move-together-but-their-contents-differ."
class="level3">
<h3>The listings seem to move together, but their contents differ.</h3>
<p>There is probably a discrepancy between the version you imported and
the version you launched. This should not happen with
<code>termmines</code>, but perhaps you re-ran <code>make</code> between
importing and launching? For other system libraries, this could happen
if you or an administrator applied system updates since you imported.
You probably need to re-import the affected module image(s). If this
happens to you in practice, and you have substantial investment in the
old import, consider using the Version Tracker to port your knowledge to
the new import.</p>
</section>
<section id="there-is-no-step-button." class="level3">
<h3>There is no step button.</h3>
<p>This can happen if the Control Mode is set to the Trace. Perhaps you
played with the Time window? Change the Control Mode back to “Control
Target.”</p>
</section>
<section
id="i-can-step-but-i-dont-see-the-effects-in-the-interpreter-window."
class="level3">
<h3>I can step, but I don’t see the effects in the Interpreter
window.</h3>
<p>This can happen if the Control Mode is set to the Emulator. Change
the Control Mode back to “Control Target.”</p>
</section>
<section id="the-step-buttons-are-grayed-out." class="level3">
<h3>The Step buttons are grayed out.</h3>
<p>The target has likely terminated, or you have not selected a thread.
Check the Threads window. If it is empty, re-launch, and perhaps look at
the Troubleshooting section in <a href="A1-GettingStarted.html">Getting
Started</a></p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="exercise-step-around" class="level2">
<h2>Exercise: Step Around</h2>
<p>If you were not already following along with an instructor, then try
some of the stepping buttons. One of the first subroutines called in
<code>termmines</code> parses command-line arguments. Try stepping until
you have entered that subroutine. <strong>TIP</strong>: Use the
Decompiler to help you recognize when you have entered the command-line
parsing subroutine. Alternatively, use the Static Listing and Decompiler
to identify the parsing subroutine (as you would in the CodeBrowser),
and then use the Step buttons to drive the target into it.</p>
